## CRESST-II Data for Yellin
_______________

Two data sets for CRESST-II detectors *Lise* and *TUM40*. All necessary input data is found in the respective folder and information such as exposure, threshold etc. can be found in the corresponding paper on ArXiv https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.08157.pdf. 

There is a slight difference to the CRESST-III data, as the cut-efficiency function and the acceptance probability function are combined in one file for each target nucleus. This has to be accounted for in the code.
